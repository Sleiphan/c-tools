 * A circular buffer.
 * 
 * Internally, the buffer employs doubled address space,
 * meaning that `buffer[i] == buffer[i + buffer_size]` is always true.
 * This completely avoids the use of modulo statements, improving performance for programs
 * using large amounts of smaller read and write operations on this circular buffer.
 * 
 * The downside of this is that the internal buffer's size must be aligned with the system's memory page size,
 * making this implementation less suitable for situations requiring tight memory allocations.
